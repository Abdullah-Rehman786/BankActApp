# BankActApp
## Description: Bank Account Console App in C#
- Create different account types: Chekcing, Gift Card, Savings, and Line of Credit.
- Allows users to make deposits and make withdrawals with exception handling for negative dollar amounts and handling for withdrawals that exceed balance
- Generates "report" of account transaction history using StringBuilder class


## Skills demostrated:
- Inheritence: Different accounts types derive from and build on the functionality of base BankAccount
- Polymorphism: Base virtual method is overridden by derived classes to change the functionality of methods to suit their uses
- Encapsulation: BankAccount and transaction classes keep implementation details (methods, properties, etc) private and only allow interaction through public fields
- Overloaded constructors
- Exception Handling
- Nullable return types
